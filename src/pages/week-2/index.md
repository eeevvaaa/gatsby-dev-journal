Detailed Analysis

Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did. This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and at least three screenshots.

Ticket 2 Pages/article GET POST

###

It has been a huge learning curve with Django REST API implementation. I struggle with finding reference from what I already know and relate to what I am learning. I was able to log in to the account and make GET and POST request, however, I was not able to figured out the GET BY ID, POST, and DELETE requests due to they all need to target the id of the specific article.
