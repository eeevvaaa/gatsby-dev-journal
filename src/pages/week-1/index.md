Frontend ticket 2

###

Initialized frontend app structure set up has made me realized that there are so many moving parts when setting up a project from scratch.
When setting up for the app structure, I created a folder for each components, and each folder has a index.js file to organize the exports.
Since we decided to go with React Redux, I set up a container folder and store folder for actions and reducers for better organization.
